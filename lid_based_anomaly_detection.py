Anomaly detection based on parametric modeling of the distribution of local intrinsic dimension.
The local intrinsic dimension (LID) estimates are calculated at each nominal data point based on the maximum
likelihood estimator from [1] and [2]. The distribution of LID values from nominal data is then modeled parametrically
using a mixture of Log-Normal densities. In other words, the log of the LID values are modeled using a mixture
of Normal densities. Given a test point, its LID estimate and p-value under the parametric density model are
calculated. A very small p-value corresponds to an anomalous test point.
